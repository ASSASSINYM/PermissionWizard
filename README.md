## Requirements

- iOS 10 / macOS 10.15 Catalina
- Xcode 12.2
- Swift 5

## Installation

### [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org)

To integrate **PermissionWizard** into your Xcode project, add it to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'PermissionWizard'
```

By default, the library will be installed fully.

Due to Apple‚Äôs policy regarding system permissions, your app may be rejected due to mention of API that is not actually used. It is recommended to only install components that you need. In this case you will not have any troubles. ‚ö†Ô∏è

```ruby
pod 'PermissionWizard/Assets' # Icons and localized strings
pod 'PermissionWizard/Bluetooth'
pod 'PermissionWizard/Calendars'
pod 'PermissionWizard/Camera'
pod 'PermissionWizard/Contacts'
pod 'PermissionWizard/FaceID'
pod 'PermissionWizard/Health'
pod 'PermissionWizard/Home'
pod 'PermissionWizard/LocalNetwork'
pod 'PermissionWizard/Location'
pod 'PermissionWizard/Microphone'
pod 'PermissionWizard/Motion'
pod 'PermissionWizard/Music'
pod 'PermissionWizard/Notifications'
pod 'PermissionWizard/Photos'
pod 'PermissionWizard/Reminders'
pod 'PermissionWizard/Siri'
pod 'PermissionWizard/SpeechRecognition'
```

Do not specify `pod 'PermissionWizard'` if you install separate components.

### [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)

To integrate **PermissionWizard** into your Xcode project, add it to your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "debug45/PermissionWizard"
```

By default, the library is compiled fully when you build the project.

Due to Apple‚Äôs policy regarding system permissions, your app may be rejected due to mention of API that is not actually used. It is recommended to only enable components that you need. In this case you will not have any troubles. ‚ö†Ô∏è

To only enable components that you need, create the `PermissionWizard.xcconfig` file in the root directory of your project. Put appropriate settings into the file according to the following template:

```
ENABLED_FEATURES = ASSETS BLUETOOTH CALENDARS CAMERA CONTACTS FACE_ID HEALTH HOME LOCAL_NETWORK LOCATION MICROPHONE MOTION MUSIC NOTIFICATIONS PHOTOS REMINDERS SIRI SPEECH_RECOGNITION
SWIFT_ACTIVE_COMPILATION_CONDITIONS = $(inherited) $(ENABLED_FEATURES) CUSTOM_SETTINGS
```

Customize the first line of the template removing unnecessary component names.

## How to Use

Using of **PermissionWizard** is incredibly easy!

```swift
import PermissionWizard

Permission.contacts.checkStatus { status in
    status // .notDetermined
}

do {
    try Permission.location.requestAccess(whenInUseOnly: true) { status in
        status.value // .whenInUseOnly
        status.isAccuracyReducing // false
    }
    
    Permission.camera.checkStatus(withMicrophone: true) { status in
        status.camera // .granted
        status.microphone // .denied
    }
} catch let error {
    error.userInfo["message"] // You must add a row with the ‚ÄùNSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription‚Äú key to your app‚Äòs plist file and specify the reason why you are requesting access to location. This information will be displayed to a user.
    
    guard let error = error as? Permission.Error else {
        return
    }
    
    error.type // .missingPlistKey
}
```

Some permission types support additional features. For example, if an iOS 14 user allows access to his location with reduced accuracy only, you can request temporary access to full accuracy:

```swift
try? Permission.location.requestTemporaryPreciseAccess(purposePlistKey: "Default") { result in
    result // true
}
```

Unfortunately, the ability to work with certain permission types is limited by default system API. For example, you can check the current status of a local network permission by requesting it only.

### Info.plist

For each permission type you are using, Apple requires to add the corresponding string to your `Info.plist` that describes a purpose of your access requests. **PermissionWizard** can help you to find the name of a necessary plist key:

```swift
Permission.faceID.usageDescriptionPlistKey // NSFaceIDUsageDescription

Permission.health.readingUsageDescriptionPlistKey // NSHealthUpdateUsageDescription
Permission.health.writingUsageDescriptionPlistKey // NSHealthShareUsageDescription
```

If you request access to some permission using default system API but forget to edit your `Info.plist`, the app will crash. However with **PermissionWizard** the crash will not occur ‚Äî you just use `try?`.

### Thread Management

In some cases default system API may return a result in a different dispatch queue. Instead of risking a crash and using `DispatchQueue.main.async`, you can ask **PermissionWizard** to always invoke completion blocks in a preferred queue:

```swift
Permission.preferredQueue = .main // Default setting
```

### UI Assets

If your UI needs permission type icons or localized names, you can easily get it using **PermissionWizard**:

```swift
let permission = Permission.speechRecognition.self

imageView.image = permission.getIcon(squircle: true)
label.text = permission.getLocalizedName() // Speech Recognition
```

Keep in mind that icons and localized strings are only available if the `Assets` component of **PermissionWizard** is installed (CocoaPods) or enabled (Carthage). All system localizations are supported.

## Known Issues

- Bluetooth permission always returns `.granted` on simulators
- Local Network permission does not work on simulators
- Microphone permission always returns `.granted` on simulators with iOS 10 or 11
- Music permission does not work on simulators with iOS 12

## Roadmap

- Extend support of macOS (specific permission types, native icons)
- Make the library compatible with Swift Package Manager
