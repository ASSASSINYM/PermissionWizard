<br/>
üñ• Works great with **Mac Catalyst**

‚úã Supports **all existing permission types**
<br/>
üõ° Provides crash free by **validating your plist** keys
<br/>
üì¨ Use **completion blocks** even where it is not provided by system API
<br/>
üõ£ Forget about **thread management** by using only convenient dispatch queue (optional)

üöÄ Completely written in **Swift**
<br/>
üç≠ Unifies your code, **regardless of permission types** you are working with
<br/>
üñº Includes **native icons** and **string constants** for your UI (optional)
<br/>
üçï Modular, add to your project **only what you need**

## Requirements

- iOS 10 / macOS 10.15 Catalina
- Swift 5

## Installation

### [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/)

To integrate **PermissionWizard** into your Xcode project add it to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'PermissionWizard'
```

By default the library is installed fully.

Due to Apple‚Äôs policy regarding system permissions your app may be rejected due to mention of API that it does not actually use. It is recommended to install only components that you need. In this case you will not have any troubles. ‚ö†Ô∏è

```ruby
pod 'PermissionWizard/Icons' # Native permission type icons
pod 'PermissionWizard/Bluetooth'
pod 'PermissionWizard/Calendars'
pod 'PermissionWizard/Camera'
pod 'PermissionWizard/Contacts'
pod 'PermissionWizard/FaceID'
pod 'PermissionWizard/Health'
pod 'PermissionWizard/Home'
pod 'PermissionWizard/LocalNetwork'
pod 'PermissionWizard/Location'
pod 'PermissionWizard/Microphone'
pod 'PermissionWizard/Motion'
pod 'PermissionWizard/Music'
pod 'PermissionWizard/Notifications'
pod 'PermissionWizard/Photos'
pod 'PermissionWizard/Reminders'
pod 'PermissionWizard/SpeechRecognition'
```

If you install separate components you should do not specify `pod 'PermissionWizard'` anymore.

### [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/)

To integrate **PermissionWizard** into your Xcode project add it to your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "debug45/PermissionWizard"
```

By default when you build your project the library is compiled fully.

Due to Apple‚Äôs policy regarding system permissions, your app may be rejected due to mention of API that it does not actually use. It is recommended to enable only components that you use. In this case you will not have any troubles. ‚ö†Ô∏è

To enable only components that you need create the `PermissionWizard.xcconfig` file in the root directory of your project and put there appropriate settings using the following template:

```
ENABLED_FEATURES = ICONS BLUETOOTH CALENDARS CAMERA CONTACTS FACE_ID HEALTH HOME LOCAL_NETWORK LOCATION MICROPHONE MOTION MUSIC NOTIFICATIONS PHOTOS REMINDERS SPEECH_RECOGNITION
SWIFT_ACTIVE_COMPILATION_CONDITIONS = $(inherited) $(ENABLED_FEATURES) CUSTOM_SETTINGS
```

Please edit the first line of the template removing unnecessary component names.

## How to Use

Using of **PermissionWizard** is incredibly easy!

```swift
import PermissionWizard

Permission.contacts.checkStatus { status in
    status // .notDetermined
}

Permission.location.requestAccess(whenInUseOnly: true) { status in
    status.value // .whenInUseOnly
    status.isAccuracyReducing // false
}

Permission.camera.checkStatus(withMicrophone: true) { status in
    status.camera // .granted
    status.microphone // .denied
}
```

Some permission types support additional features. For example if on iOS 14 a user allows access to his location with reduced accuracy only you can request temporary access to full accuracy:

```swift
Permission.location.requestTemporaryPreciseAccess(purposePlistKey: "Default") { result in
    result // true
}
```

Unfortunately the ability to work with certain permission types is limited by system API. For example you can check the current status of a local network permission by requesting it only.

### Info.plist

Please keep in mind that to work with each permission Apple requires you to add corresponding string to your `Info.plist` that describes purpose for which you are requesting access. **PermissionWizard** can help you to find the name of a necessary key:

```swift
Permission.faceID.usageDescriptionPlistKey // NSFaceIDUsageDescription

Permission.health.readingUsageDescriptionPlistKey // NSHealthUpdateUsageDescription
Permission.health.writingUsageDescriptionPlistKey // NSHealthShareUsageDescription
```

If you request access to some permission using plain system API but forget to edit your `Info.plist` the app will crash. However with **PermissionWizard** the crash will not occur ‚Äî you will just see an informative warning in the debugger log.

### Thread Management

In some cases the plain system permissions API may return results in a different dispatch queues than the one you requested from. Instead of risking a crash and using `DispatchQueue.main.async` you can ask **PermissionWizard** to always invoke completion blocks in a convenient queue:

```swift
Permission.preferredQueue = .main // Default setting
```

### UI Assets

If your UI needs permission icons or string names you can easily get it using **PermissionWizard**:

```swift
let permission = Permission.localNetwork.self
imageView.image = permission.icon

titleLabel.text = permission.titleName // Local Network
descriptionLabel.text = "Please allow access to your \(permission.contextName)" // local network
```

Please do not forget that icons are available only if the `Icons` component of **PermissionWizard** is installed (CocoaPods) or enabled (Carthage).

**PermissionWizard** provides icons without rounding and borders. If you want to get the design like in iOS system preferences use the following code:

```swift
imageView.layer.cornerRadius = 7
imageView.clipToBounds = true

if permission.shouldBorderIcon, #available(iOS 11, *) {
    imageView.layer.borderWidth = 1 / (window?.screen.scale ?? 1)
    imageView.layer.borderColor = UIColor(white: 0.898, alpha: 1).cgColor // #E5E5E5
}
```

## Known issues

- Bluetooth permission always returns `.granted` on a simulator
- Local Network permission does not work on a simulator
- Microphone permission always returns `.granted` on a simulator with iOS 10 or 11
- Music permission does not work on a simulator with iOS 12

## Library Roadmap

- NFC permission support
- Swift Package Manager compatibility
